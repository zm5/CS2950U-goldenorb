Welcome to GoldenOrb

GoldenOrb is a cloud-based open source project for massive-scale graph analysis, built upon best-of-breed software from the Apache Hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org) project modeled after Google’s Pregel (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1807184) architecture. Our goal is to foster solutions to complex data problems, remove limits to innovation and contribute to the emerging ecosystem that spans all aspects of big data analysis.

GoldenOrb is open-sourced under the Apache Software Foundation License v2.0.
